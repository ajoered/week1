You can use each for pretty much every task you have to do with arrays.
You can use map to transform all the items in an array to get a new one.
You can use reduce to accumulate a single value from all the items.
You can use select to remove items from an array easily.
You can use find to pick out a single item in an array.
You can use sort to change the order of an array.
